## Overview

SISCOM Electrónica is an institution in Mexico City for anyone interested in technology and engineering. Despite its physical success, its digital presence did not reflect the magnitude of its market impact. Arko MKT took on the challenge of digitizing this commercial authority from scratch.

## The Challenge

The main challenge was to transfer the trust and massive inventory of a traditional physical store to digital platforms, connecting with a new generation of "makers" and technology professionals without alienating its historic customer base.

## The Solution

We implemented a 360 strategy that ranged from identity redesign to high-impact audiovisual production:
- **Audiovisual Strategy:** Creation of dynamic content showing the utility and variety of components.
- **Digital Communication:** We established an expert but accessible tone of voice.
- **Performance Marketing:** Segmented campaigns to attract qualified traffic to both the physical store and its digital channels.

The result was explosive community growth, reaching follower milestones in record time and modernizing the brand perception.
