## Overview

Vanessa Ramírez had a growing community and a solid educational offering, but her course management was highly inefficient due to the lack of automated tools. The entire process, from registration to certification, was performed manually.

## The Challenge

Vanessa's team lost hours sending links, adding students to databases, manually requesting information, and generating certificates one by one. This limited scalability and affected user experience.

## The Solution

We designed and developed an integral digital academy that automated every touchpoint:
- **Registration Automation:** Integration of payment systems with automatic course enrollment.
- **Student Management:** A centralized dashboard for tracking student progress and data.
- **Automatic Certification:** Instant generation of personalized certificates upon module completion.

Thanks to this transformation, Vanessa's team can now focus exclusively on content creation and human guidance, while the system handles the operational logistics.
