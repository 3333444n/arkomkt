## Overview

Urban Ink x Eliel Art sought to professionalize its image to stand out in the competitive tattoo and barber scene in Mexico City. They needed a brand that communicated both artistic quality and the exclusive atmosphere of their studio.

## The Challenge

The studio operated without a unified visual identity, making brand recognition difficult. Furthermore, content generation was sporadic and failed to capture the detail and passion of Eliel and his team's work.

## The Solution

We executed a complete visual and strategic transformation:
- **Identity Redesign:** We created a brand that reflects the urban lifestyle with a touch of sophistication.
- **Content Strategy:** Constant production of reels and high-quality photography showing the artistic process and final results.
- **Light Automation:** We implemented n8n to more efficiently manage appointment requests and client communication.

The studio has managed to consolidate a loyal and passionate community, elevating its status to a benchmark for art and style in the city.
